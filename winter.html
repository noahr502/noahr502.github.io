  <p> Another absolute fan favorite is skiing for the absolute rush this activity
    consistently creates. Obviously, only really offered in the Winter for the
    simple fact that snow only really falls during this time of year (in Montana)
    to be able to shred and do some of the most amazing terrain exploring
    that you might ever do in your life. This is also the home to many bucketlist
    items that fall all across the world, pretty much wherever snow falls, there
    is a mountain. This activity is completely possible for people of all skill
    levels, whether you are a novice skier or a seasoned expert, every mountain
    has something that suits you. Much like cliff jumping, it can get very
    dangerous at times which means to stay within your abilities and always ski
    with a buddy but challenge yourself because it is amazing what you will
    be able to achieve after a very small amount of time put into it. Now, get
    out there and shred the gnar!</p>
