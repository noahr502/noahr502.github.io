    <p>Here at Vans, we are dedicated to bringing the best out of the youth.
    We continue to try to inspire youth culture and provide kids and young
    adults with an avenue to express themselves.</p>

    <p>The value offered here at Vans is an extremely high quality manufactured
    shoe with a giant variation in styles from the type of shoe to the very
    unique shoe patterns.</p>

    <p>Vans has been 'off the wall' since 1966. The versatility of our products
    has been a work in process ever since with consistent ground breaking
    releases such as the slip-on style back in 1976 as well as Vans Snowboard
    Boot in 1993. Now, the innovative focus has shifted to extremely personalized
    products that any customer has the ability to design.
    See the link below to explore all customizable designs to find the best
    fit for you!  </p>
