    <p>There is a very wide range of activities that you can choose to fill your
      time with but it can be a struggle to decide which ones would be the best to
      fill your time with. This becomes a more significant problem with the change
      in season especially in states such as Montana where each season couldn't
      be more different than the season before and after it.  With such a limited
      amount of time for each seasons, information overload, and so many great
      activities that are offered no matter what type of weather is seen
      in whatever location, it can definitely be overwhelming.</p>

    <p> I, personally, am such an expert in this field since I live in Montana
      and tend to experience very severe seasons and the weather that comes with
      it.  I am also an well-traveled outdoorsman that seizes the moment to the
      best of my ability which entails me doing a lot of activities in every
      condition. I am dedicated to help aggravated users like whoever is looking
      at this now understand that there is hope for you to get off your couch
      and get active if you are willing to do it even if it is cold.</p>

    <p> Now remember, this is an opinion peice so don't judge me or try to fight
      me for what I think and how I tend to spend my time outside of ridiculous
      obligations.  If you got a problem with that, look within because you don't
      even know me. This includes my favorite year round athletic activity,
      which is and will always be soccer.</p>
