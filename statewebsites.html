<h1> 1. My Favorite State Website</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Maryland</a></h2>

<p> After looking at all of these state websites, this was by far my favorite.
Visually, it is very asthetically pleasing thanks to the use of different
vibrant colors that correlate with the color of the actual state flag. The
layout is perfect because everything is very linear and methodical with
which envisions the way that someone would be browsing through the website. You
can quickly see a lot of interesting information by just a quick scroll such as
the social media page which includes recent tweets coming from the heads of the
state. The menu is very easy to navigate because opens every link in a new tab
which allows you to easily switch back to the original tab if you did not find
what you wanted or if you didn't mean to go there. It seems really easy to find
everything that you would need because they tend to provide way more information
than they would need to but they have a general link like "Business" so if you
need to find updated news about the business environment you click on that
link and it is just a quick scroll away which is very organized. This website
also seems like it was made for use on any screen because there was no difference
looking at it in full screen or half screen on a laptop or a mobile,
it appeared the exact same way. Through the visual appeal, ease of use,
scrolability, and entertainment from their content like their social media page,
no others really compared to this website. </p>

<h1> 2. The Second Best State Website</h1>
<h2><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov">Arkansas</a></h2>

<p> Following Maryland is the Arkansas state website.  For the design, I really
  like the colors and font that they chose.  There was also a lot of pictures
  that help with the visual appeal as well as the adventure feel that they try
  to create with their users.  The website loads fairly quickly with the
  exception of the pictures which seem to take a second before it shoots you
  loads you back in. Some links like the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance
  don't load in unless you click them in certain spots. The menu drop down is
  kind of hard to locate but once you find it section has its own drop down
  menu to find the specific section that you need which is really convenient.
  This makes everything pretty easy to find if you know what you are looking for
  but might require some searching. I do like the function they added for extra
  help which allows you to immediately start a conversation with a customer
  service representative if you are struggling to find something like a vehicle
  registration renewal. After using it in a small window on a laptop and my
  mobile phone, I came to the conclusion that they made it equally usable and
  fast on for both with the only problem being difficulty with switching display
  options. I also really appreciated their effort to increase tourism in their
  state by providing awareness for some of the cool places that are located in
  their state that I would assume most people don't know about. Who knew someone
  could make me want to go to Morrilton, Arkansas? </p>

<h1> 3. The Most Mediocre State Website</h1>
<h2><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h2>

<p> I was really disappointed with the visuality of this website, they had
  most to work with in the end. There are barely any pictures when they have so
  many cool glaciers and volcanos that they could have put in there. The colors
  bored me right to sleep and the font was way too small, it might as well of.
  The layout is very nice, on the other hand, it flows really nicely on the eye
  since they are all located in their own little boxes. The website itself loads
  in a little slower but all the links are pretty fast  and has the ease of
  going back and forth because they are all next to each other since it won't
  take you to a new page or anything. The menu is super easy to navigate because
  you don't have to go to a new page to find anything without going directly
  into specifics. The state of Alaska task bar is kind of out of the way
  and really small but other drop downs allow you to see the specific like
  safety information of account information. It doesn't work very well in
  a smaller window and it shows up way too small on mobile and the drop down
  menu doesn't work the same since you can't hover over it with a mousepad.
  For a final observation, the online shop was a great idea which I haven't
  seen on any other state website.  It allowed you to buy licenses and permits
  from Fish and Game without leaving the actual website which was extremely
  helpful for someone going on the state website to find out how that all works.

<h1> 4. The Second Worst State Website</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">Maine</a></h2>

<p> Next up is the functionable but very boring website of the state of
  Maine. Visually, in ways it looks nice but in others it kind of just looks
  like it looks an uninspired government site like they don't have a state to
  promote. All the pictures showcase some high level photography skills and
  shows the potential of the state while, at the same time, it is too wordy.
  There is also just a map with cool features but it doesn't add anything for the eye. The
  site itself loads in pretty fast without problems with loading in all the
  information which is quite the feat while also having a search bar that takes
  what feels like an eternity to load. The menu has a few options on how to
  navigate whether it is the drop down menu or a button but it loads too much
  information to the point I don't really sift through all of it to find what I
  want. It is actually very easy to navigate despite all the information
  because there are links to everything except returning home. In smaller windows,
  it works fine but some of the pictures and words overlap while that doesn't
  happen on mobile where it seems more methodical than on the laptop. Lastly, I
  really liked the Map It! function that they have where you can place state park,
   mv branches,court houses, and others on the map I mentioned earlier.
   That is a very creative use of GIS that is helpful for anyone that lives in
   Maine. </p>

<h1> 5. The Worst State Website</h1>
<h2><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov">Kansas</a></h2>

<p> The worst of the worst was Kansas. From a visual standpoint,
 to me, it just looks extremely empty.  The mural that is used as the background
 just kind of looks out of place since there is no context at all.  None of the
 colors work really at all together, it is just a complete mess without any
 real structure or formatting. The layout, while it is simple, isn't all that
 clear because it seems like everything can be found in the search bar but some
 things can't be, it is very confusing.It loads as fast as you type which was fast
 for me but might not be fast for others. Some links are lightning fast others are
 dead slow compared to the rest of the websites. Entering the website is pretty
 average.  The menu is not very easy to navigate because you have to search
 something before it ever even appears which is unneccessary in a completely
 different tab which isn't a problem but it is easy to get lost in. Also, many
 of the searches that I made led nowhere which was very frustrating when all
 other websites had clear navigation set up for the users. There is a tab for
 answers that it gives you generally and then an "All of Kansas
 .gov" tab which comes up with hundred of thousands of results so where
 should people search for what they want? As far as when I accessed the site on
 the mobile, it was permissible but very slow for a lot of the links. Overall,
 due to the agravating search bar that makes this website work like a worse
 Google which is where a user just came from and the confusing nature of
 specific information, this ends up being my last choice.
