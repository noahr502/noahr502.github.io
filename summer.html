<p> This is probably my favorite activity that I do throughout the year with
  Summer being the only time that this activity is actually possible. This
  is the time of the year that the water is deep enough and the weather is
  warm enough(for most, that is) to really be able to enjoy the plunge! It
  doesn't matter who you are, there is a cliff that you will easily be able to
  send it off of. There are no judgments for what you are able to do. Just think
  of all of the amazing locations that this activity is an option for, Hawaii,
  all across Europe, Asia, and even your back yard! This is an activity that
  can be dangerous so make sure that you depth check and never do anything that
  you aren't completely comfortable with. Happy diving!</p>
