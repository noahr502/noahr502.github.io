    <h1>Media </h1>
    <p> My personal favorite because I grew up on the mountain is Whitefish Mountain
      Resort. Dozens of olympic athletes have come from this mountain to go on to
      achieve brilliant things such as some of the skiiers within the video below.
      It is also known as one of the most superior ski towns in North America
      while it maintains a small town style of comfort with a very family oriented
      vibe.  There is also plenty of night life for the older folks that is
      usually highlighted by live music at many taverns.  As you can tell, there
      is something for everyone there. With  10 chairlifts and 111 marked trails,
      you surely won't get bored.</p>

    <p> The location of Whitefish Mountain Resort is one that is pretty unheard
      of across the rest of the nation.  It is located a short 15 to 20 minute
      drive from all around town and only about an hour from the Canadian border
      which provides for other traveling opportunities.  Located about 45 minutes
      to the east is Glacier National Park, one of the most beautiful parks
      in the world that provide for insane panoramic views with Whitefish Lake and
      the town very visible from other vantage points. The mountain also has a
      picturesque village with a market and four or five different restaurants for
      different eatery options.</p>
