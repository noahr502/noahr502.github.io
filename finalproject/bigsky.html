<p> This one is the most popular ski resort within Montana. Big Sky is has the most acreage out of any other in Montana which is a testament to how much you can ski throughout the mountain. It includes 4 mountains,
300 runs that span across 22 chairs that range in difficulty. It even includes
7 different terrain parks that allow for a greater distribution of traffic in
all areas. It also has the only 6 person chairlift in all of Montana.</p>

<p>The location of Big Sky is definitely not where it would be expected to be as
a cause of the pristine reputation that it has received. That being said, it is
not difficult to get there from the surrounding areas with a close proximity to
Bozeman and Yellowstone National Park that give it great views. Big is also home
to the Yellowstone Club that offers a different experience of the mountain that
is more like luxury with many celebrities and others spending a lot of time there.
With the closest skiing to what I would consider European skiing, it is superior. </p>

<h2> Price Table </h2>
<a> <img src="slideshow/images/bstix.png" alt="" width="50%" height="50%">
  <p> As you can see, Big Sky has by far the most expensive tickets throughout
    all of Montana. Obviously, it comes for a reason with all of what it has to
    offer but this is the reason that it falls to second in comparison with Whitefish.
    Unlike the other mountains, there really aren't any sources for discounts
    whether that is college or children like Whitefish, which is a biggest criticism
    for the management team.
