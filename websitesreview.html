  <h1>The Best Website of Them All</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://paperplanes.world/">paperplanes</a></h2>
  <p>This website is phenomenal.  This website is very interactive and different
  than any other website that I have ever seen before in my life.  This website
  takes a completely different approach which is something that I completely
  support.  This website is used as what could be looked at as an attempt to
  connect opposite as well as random places throughout the world.  This works
  like an interactive and virtual postcard with a variety of stamps from the
  location where the paper plane is thrown from originally.  Anyone can also
  catch these paperplanes that are thrown from all around the world and place
  a stamp from their town on which then intermixes with other stamps. Looking
  at the code, it is extremely clean and modern since it is all beautified, it
  is nicely structured, spreading out HTML commands based on the purpose they
  are being used for which are all commands we have gone over in class. This does
  seem to be heavily reliant on Javascript as well. The code commands in use are
  metas, links, and scripts.  All sizes of the images and
  motion pictures are done in sizes and connect through hrefs as well as contents.
  There are no tables, the code looks simple. This website does validate but
  there are a few errors which come from itemprop attributes not being a property
  to any specific item from within. The layout does make a lot of sense due to
  the fact everything is set up in a horizontal grid which matches the style of
  the central part of the site which is the rotating globe in the center of the
  page. It ends up being 1 row or 2 row site depending on the amount of
  information that is being shared at that specific moment. It is really easy to
  navigate since there is it fairly simple concept of operation.  It is well
  done because there is no possible way to get lost and the desired path
  only requires three steps in the process that can be repeated.  For the colors,
  it only uses 3 that definitely don't clash which are purple, light blue, and
  white besides the stamps that are every color imaginable. The background color
  fades between the light blue as well as purple that gives almost an animated
  vibe. I think that the creators try to go for a new age and pondering vibe that
  and the colors matching the sky with the light blue really ties in well but
  I am a little lost in why the colored the land of the Earth blue with purple
  water but it is very eye-popping.  The little things that set this apart are
  the little jet streams that follow the paper planes, how the world zooms in and
  out, as well as the floating effect that they use for lettering that enters
  above a strike zone that shows the city and part of the Earth it comes from.
  Lastly, it does a great job of displaying what it would be the interactivity
  by seeing where your plane travels too along with the ones that you stamp.
  This a great way to be a citizen of the world from your own laptop and to fill
  your mind with wonder and adventure. </p>


  <h1>The Website That Was Still Pretty Good</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/">hellomonday</a></h2>
  <p>Hellomonday is next up with the creative digital production that they put
  into use that gives them a lot of freedom to work with. They use a series of
   different artistic techniques that allow you to take a deeper look at
  in order to see how they did it and other information such as telling impactful
  stories. One of which that I read talked about the use of Google search
  engines and other applications such as Maps for the greater good including
  transporting blood using Google Maps in Nigeria, Android Flint water crisis
  solutions, and a Native American woman that discovered the ins and outs of
  applying for FAFSA for college. This is just the tip of the iceberg for the
  different stories and graphics with links to Youtube such as Creators for
  Change which is influencer based marketing movemement that is dedicated
  to fight hate groups online and also an in depth look into Lyft's social
  marketing narrative.  The code does look clean and modern with just a very
  significant amount of html commands such as divs, navs, and styles in every
  section. I will say that I understand the formatting of the code but it can
  definitely be hard to follow since it goes every direction across the page.
  It also gets a lot more complex with code included like g and path
  that requires at least two lines of code in a series of numbers and letters.
  It seems like there is way too much in here but many this is what is needed
  to create an elaborate website but there is over thousands of lines of code.
  This website does validate but there are 76 errors that come from every
  element that is used but that is actually not awful considering how much
  code there is associated with this website's makeup,no tables are in use.
  You think they would use that command simply with the amount code that
  a person has to scroll through.  The layout of the page is great, very
  easy to follow visually with a 2 collum first page that then sends the user
  into text-based and stand alone graphics that are extremely adaptive to
  scrolling.  Every segment on this website adapts to the scrolling that induces
  an interaction such as a kid flying across the page or molding to where the
  cursor moves to within the box. For many of these reasons, navigation is not
  difficult but due to the amount of content, users and content creators could
  have trouble finding the right pages such as home since there is no tab for that.
  This site is very colorful but they aren't the most selective about the colors
  since they end up using too many in graphics or colors that don't match well like
  black to blue to a light purple background. I think they try to use too many
  or pack them in to tightly. I will say that it is kind of like real life
  in the use of its colors because it tries to show real outfits that people
  wear, in my opinion, and there really are strange people that wear ones like
  they have all over the screen. For little masterful things, they added many
  effects such as the molding of pictures that I talked about before, cool stories
  told through graphic transitions such as at the top of the page there is a
  two characters, a male and a female that are having fun embarassing each other
  by changing the scene and what the other one is doing such as making them shorter,
  fatter, turning them into a bear, etc. The best and most creative side of This
  website I believe is there screen transitions, it is almost like a paintbrush
   scraper effect that fills the screen from one side to the other that starts in
   every corner in special colors based on the graphic being shown. Overall,
   the interactivity and visual stimulation of this website is unparalled.

  <h1> The Most Garbage Website</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://helena.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a></h2>
  <p>The website that I chose for the most poor design and terrible ingenuity
  across all platforms is craigslist. There is nothing to really look at in this
  website, it does not offer anything that a normal website would offer as
  far as visual appeal. There is strictly just words and links all across the
  screen that do not assist the person unless they are looking for something
  specific because they show every section that they have right on the first page.
  Even the inclusion of one picture would improve this website tenfold because
  their customers are just staring at gray and blue. It needs to be revamped,
  it looks like it hasn't been worked on in eons. The code hurts my eyes.  It
  starts with what looks like a format or a structure to follow with tables
  and styles that flow nicely which is then completely abandoned to form walls
  of code that are hard to read since they all look the same because of the
  insane overuse of links. It looks about as far from modern code than I have
  ever seen in my life. The website validates, and surprisingly enough, it
  does not have a lot of errors or warnings and the same mistake was not made
  twice. I also learned that you can use autocorrect within your search bars.
  The layout is a nightmare for any designer, just starting
  with a 5 collum organization that is made up thousands of rows with the only
  scrolling effect being a simple hover command for every single link, nothing
  seems customized. The navigation is terrible with no organization, every
  page has no use of text wrap which makes it clear that all of the products
  come from an outside source. Some links have a ridiculous amount of pages
  while others have like 2 results. Also, with so much to click on, they do
  not provide you with anyway to look at the products that were previously
  investing time to look at. For the colors, it is super underwhelming. The
  only difference in color from one page to the next are the colors of
  the products and pictures of what individuals are posting.  The website
  itself only uses gray for the background at all times and then blue, red, and
  black for the text.  Every once in a while there is a neat little icon for
  a car or something that provides just a little bit of escape from that
  which doesn't go with the rest of the text at all. Color is only effectively
  used for the links since the customer will know that they are links but
  I don't think that is necessary. If they are trying to stand out as an extremely
  lazy and bland website where normal people do all the work to make this website
  worth anything then they achieved their goal. There is nothing done to this
  website that any basic designer couldn't do, their icon is a basic peace sign,
  their new additions were a craigslist app and then privacy policy. The only
  things of any note in this website are the cool design of the best of craigslist
  logo which is created by code to made a faded best of sign and a guy named
  "craigslist Joe" who created a Youtube video about him living off craigslist
  for a whole year. They even included a back-to-top button for pages where
  you don't need to scroll down or up really at all to be at the top and the
  bottom.  There is never any creative use of text design, it is always the same
  unless it is bolded or placed in unneccessary bullet points or headings that
  don't make any sense. The website logo itself is just a black CL inside of
  a oval. This website is truly abismal and has me almost wanting to redo it
  all myself to make it worth an unassuming user's eye.</p>
