<p>GoDaddy is one of the most popular web domains on the planet roughly 20
  million website creators over the many years that it has been operation.  They
  run on a simple campaign of only needing three series of clicks to start.
  The first click series representing the template, the second is visual design like
  colors, and the final is the selection of marketing tools after publicizing
  the domain name. The domain name (.com,.net,.quest,etc.) is as little as $2.99
  for the first year but it also offers allow for possibility of transporting multiple personal domain names

<h1>Web Host #3</h1>
<h2><a href="https://domain.com">DOMAIN</a></h2>

<p>DOMAIN is entirely different from the other web domains in the way that the
  payment can be made for between 1-5 years while most of the others are just
  a standard per year basis.  The domain names can be selected alphabetically
  to better select that one that specifically fits the customer in the best way.
  They also offer links to website builders and online store builders, marketing
  tools, and a WordPress hosting link while also offering a special addition of
  WordPress Live that offers hands on design guidance, mobile and email support

  the most expensive of the web hosting sites but it probably has the most
  opportunities.
